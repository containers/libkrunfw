Subject: [PATCH 19/20] dax: Allow block size > PAGE_SIZE

For virtio-dax, the file/FS blocksize is irrelevant. FUSE always uses
large DAX blocks (2MiB), which will work with all host page sizes. Since
we are mapping files into the DAX window on the host, the underlying
block size of the filesystem and its block device (if any) are
meaningless.

For real devices with DAX, the only requirement should be that the FS
block size is *at least* as large as PAGE_SIZE, to ensure that at least
whole pages can be mapped out of the device contiguously.

Fixes warning when using virtio-dax on a 4K guest with a 16K host,
backed by tmpfs (which sets blksz == PAGE_SIZE on the host).
